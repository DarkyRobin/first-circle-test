# Engineering Code Test
Develop a service that simulates basic banking operations in a programming language of your choice. This service will manage accounts, process deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts. The system should be designed reflecting real-world constraints of a bank.

## Requirements:

A class or set of functions that allow:
- Account creation: Allow users to create an account with an initial deposit.
- Deposit: Enable users to deposit money into their account.
- Withdrawal: Allow users to withdraw money from their account, ensuring that overdrafts are not allowed.
- Transfer: Enable transferring funds between accounts.
- Account balance: Provide the ability to check the account balance.
- 
## Database:
In-memory data storage will suffice, no need to have a database alongside the project, but you can add one at your discretion
The word “service” here is used in a “software component/module” rather “deployable unit with an API” sense, no need to provide API for it.

We propose spending no more than 2 hours on this exercise, but this is totally at your discretion.
